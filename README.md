## Note

`kumaone`'s primary objective is to enable users to perform bulk action in `uptime kuma` server. A very special thanks
to the author and contributors of the project [uptime-kuma-api](https://github.com/lucasheld/uptime-kuma-api). `kumaone`
is built by studying and understanding the code of `uptime-kuma-api` and in places I used some parts of the code as it
is from `uptime-kuma-api`. Appreciate the outstanding work done by the author and contributors of both
[uptime kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) and `uptime-kuma-api` project.

`kumaone` is a CLI application. Designed for bulk operations mainly from reading configuration files. `kumaone` is very
early in development. Contribution and constructive feedbacks are always welcome.

    automatically.
