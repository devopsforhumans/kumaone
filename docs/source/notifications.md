# Notifications

There are quite a few notification providers supported by `uptime kuma`. In practice, we use notification provider to
get notified about events and most of the time we use one or two notification providers. It is by design of `kumaone`
the configuration of the notification providers are sources from a separate file or files, unlike monitors and status
pages.

This gives the users flexibility to use same providers for multiple process monitors and events.

Example configuration of `notificaiton` provider config file

```yaml
---
notifications:
  - opsgenie:
      name: "Opsgenie Nofification"
      type: "Opsgenie"
      is_default: false
      apply_existing: false
      opsgeniePriority: 1
      opsgenieRegion: "eu" # us(default)/eu
      opsgenieApiKey: "something"
  - rocketchat:
      name: "RocketChat Notification"
      type: "rocket.chat"
      is_default: false
      apply_existing: false
      rocketwebhookURL: "https://chat.homelab.do"
      rocketiconemo: "rocket"
      rocketusername: "bot"
      rocketchannel: "somechannel"
```

```{hint}
Currently each of the notificaiton provider has it's own required parameters and `kumaone` doesn't have any CLI
commands to expose them to the user. This feature is planned but not yet implemented. See `examples` directory in
`GitHub` for references.
```

```

## Add notification

To add notification(s), use `add` subcommand with `notifications` command. To provide the notification config file
use `--notifications` or `-n` option with file path as argument.

```shell
kumaone notifications add --notifications examples/notification.config.example.yaml
```

```text
$ kumaone notification add --notifications examples/notification.config.example.yaml
🥳 Uptime kuma config file found at: /Users/dalwar23/.config/kumaone/kuma.yaml

💾 Notification provider 'slack' added successfully.
💾 Notification provider 'teams' added successfully.

```

## Delete notification

Deleting notification is as easy as adding them. Provide the notification config file path to `delete` sub command with
`--notifications` option.

```shell
kumaone notification delete --notifications examples/notification.config.example.yaml
```

```text
$ kumaone notification delete --notifications examples/notification.config.example.yaml
🥳 Uptime kuma config file found at: /Users/dalwar23/.config/kumaone/kuma.yaml

```

User can also delete notifications by notification `title` or notification `id`.

kumaone notification delete --id 32
```

or


```shell
kumaone notification delete --title "Uptime slack notification"
```

```text
$ kumaone notification delete --title "Uptime slack notification"
